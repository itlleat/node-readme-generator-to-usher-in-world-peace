## Installation
To install, simply clone the code from the repository into a folder of your choosing. From your terminal navigate to the Develop folder of the application and simply run node index.js. You will be prompted to begin your README.md file!
## Usage Information
Having a quality README is an essential component to any program or application. This  application utilizes the inquirer package to create a simple boilerplate README file that you are prompted to populate, all from the command line. After going through the prompts a README.md will be created with formatting all taken care of!
## Contributing
### Guidelines
Please feel welcome to make additions, edit or expand it for your own personal use, or add pseudo code suggestions. If you'd like to make changes to the main branch please let me know through email. There is a link further  down.
## Test Instructions
Thanks to @ionscion on github for the solve for this: Install the application and create a simple README file. Preview the README file. Now, delete the README file and run the application again to create a new README.md. Open a preview of the README and if it is the same as your current inputs repeat the process until your preview of a new README file is the same as your previous inputs. Your raw file will reflect your current inputs but the preview will not. How do we solve this problem? Hint:  In VS code, the command palette reacts to what file is open in the coding window.
